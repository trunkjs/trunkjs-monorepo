# Code Styling

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistent styling across all elements in the Nextrap monorepo.

## Creating HTML-Elements

Use `create_element(tag: string, attributes: Record<string, string>, content?: string): HTMLElement` from `@trunkjs/browser-utils` to create elements. Especially in
unit-tests.



## Keep complex code out of the Web-Components

Instead create a separate module below src/utils and import it in the web-component. Do all the
basic unit-testing there. and only a Test to showcase th usage in the web-components test.

## Readme

README files are intended to be used by a developer using the package - not the packages developer.
So they want to have a quick overview of the package, the capabilities and how to use it. Show the
reade ther benefits of the package and how to use it in a few lines.

The Main README.md should contain only a short description, a small example of the core functionality
a detailed example with references to the detailed description in ./.README/000-section-name.md files

The Sections are ordered by the number in the filename, so you can use this to order the sections.

### Links to the section files

In the main README.md file, link to the section files using relative paths. For example:

```markdown
[Section Name](./README/100-section-name.md)
```

On top of the Readme file provide a ul li list to all section files in the correct order:
Example:
```markdown
- [Building the app](./.README/100-building-the-app.md)
- [Loaing data from remote](./.README/200-loading-data-from-remote.md)
    - [Loading via API](./.README/210-loading-via-api.md)
```


## Demonstration Files

Alter the `demo/index.html` file to link to dedicated demonstration files like `demo/functionality-abc.html`. 
Showcase the functionality of the package in these files. Also link to these files in the README.md or docs/*.md files.
